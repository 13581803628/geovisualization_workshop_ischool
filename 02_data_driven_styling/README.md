# 02 Data Driven Styling

In this step we style our data using one of its properties, `crash_type`. Notice that we do this by adding `stops` to our style configuration, and that the size of our circles transitions smoothly as we zoom in and out.

## Things to Try Out:

- Change the stop values for the `'circle-radius'` property. Remember that `stops` accepts an array of arrays, where each inner array has a value for zoom level and a value for the circle radius. What happens if we add more than two arrays to our `stops` array?
