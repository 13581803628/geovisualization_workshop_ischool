# 04 Adding Custom Map Controls

In this example we add a couple buttons to our map (their style could be improved, sorry!) which allow for toggling the hexbins and crashes point data on and off.

## Things to Try out

- See if you can add a slider for each layer, to change its opacity.
- What other UI elements might we need for this map? How would we go about making them?
