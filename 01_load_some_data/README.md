# 01 Load Some Data

In this step we set up an interactive map centered on New York City that is capable of being zoomed and panned. We added a basemap to give our data context, as well as basic map controls that allow the user to zoom and pan incrementally and change the map rotation and tilt.

## Things to try out:

- change the type of basemap from "dark" to "light" or "satellite" or another type

- change the styling of the GeoJSON data including the color, opacity, and radius of the circles

- try filtering the data on a property before it is loaded onto the map
